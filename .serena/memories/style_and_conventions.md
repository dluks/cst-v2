## Code quality
- Type annotations required for all functions; explicit return types
- Black formatting, 88‑char lines, double quotes, PEP 8 naming
- Docstrings: one‑liner <15 lines; full docstrings otherwise (Description, Params, Returns, Raises)
- Handle errors with meaningful exception types; avoid broad excepts; log appropriately

## Scientific & data practices
- Validate inputs; maintain data lineage; document transformations
- Use appropriate numerical precision and note assumptions/limitations
- Reproducible notebooks: end‑to‑end runnable, well‑documented, include validation/QA

## Architecture & design
- Favor simple functions; use classes sparingly
- Prefer strategy pattern for pluggable components (e.g., model backends, IO)
- Environment compatibility: support CPU/GPU and local/HPC via params/env vars

## Files to NEVER modify directly
- **dvc.lock files**: Auto-generated by DVC. Never edit manually - they are updated automatically when running `dvc repro` or similar commands.

## Testing & CI hygiene
- Unit tests in `tests/` with pytest
- Static types with pyright; style with pylint (ruff optional)
