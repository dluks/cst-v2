# Project Context: Remote Sensing and Ecology Research

This project combines Earth observation data with citizen science observations and trait data from the tri-trait database, using AutoGluon and LightGBM models for analysis.

## Key Technical Requirements
- Python-based data science project
- Data version control (DVC) for managing data pipelines
- Spatial block cross-validation using H3 hexagons
- AutoGluon models with light-GBM
- Support for both local and HPC environments

## Project Structure
- Project parameters are defined in [params.yaml](mdc:params.yaml)
- DVC.lock files are unique per branch to avoid cache pollution
- Separate treatments (resolutions, input combinations) managed via git branches
- Spatial analysis using spherical variograms and H3 hexagons
- Spatial cross-validation
- Final model trained on complete dataset

## Project Design Patterns
- Use Python classes sparingly, but when appropriate.
- Prefer to follow the strategy pattern, utilizing interfaces when implementing potentially modular processing.
- Examples of modular processing are: model training (i.e. which ML approach/framework is used), data inputs and outputs of each stage, etc.
