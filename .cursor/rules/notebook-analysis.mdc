# Notebook Documentation Requirements

## Scientific Reproducibility
- All new functionality must be documented in the `notebooks` directory
- Each major feature or analysis must have a corresponding Jupyter notebook
- Notebooks must be executable from start to finish
- Include clear explanations of methodology and assumptions

## Notebook Structure
- See the current `notebooks` directory for examples.
- Start with a clear title and description
- Include a "Background" section explaining the scientific context
- Document all data sources and preprocessing steps
- Show intermediate results and visualizations
- Include error analysis and validation steps
- End with conclusions and next steps

## Code Quality in Notebooks
- Follow the same code quality standards as the main codebase
- Include type annotations in function definitions
- Use markdown cells for clear documentation
- Keep code cells focused and well-commented
- Include error handling and validation

## Data and Results
- Document all input data sources
- Show data validation steps
- Include visualizations of results
- Document any data transformations
- Show model performance metrics
- Include statistical analysis where relevant

## Version Control
- Notebooks must be version controlled
- Include clear cell execution order
- Document any external dependencies
- Note the version of key packages used
- Include timestamps for reproducibility

## Best Practices
- Use consistent formatting
- Include clear section headers
- Document any assumptions made
- Show intermediate results
- Include error analysis
- Document any limitations
- Link to relevant scientific literature
