# Testing Requirements

## Unit Testing
- All functions must have corresponding unit tests
- Use PyTest for all testing
- Test both success and failure cases
- Prefer to write tests in a way that avoids mocking
- Mock external dependencies ONLY when necessary.
- Prioritize key behavioral testing.
- Aim for high test coverage if possible.

## Integration Testing
- Test complete data pipeline workflows
- Verify data transformations
- Test DVC pipeline stages
- Validate data integrity

## Performance Testing
- Test HPC compatibility
- Benchmark critical operations
- Monitor memory usage
- Test scalability

## Data Validation
- Validate input data formats
- Check data consistency
- Verify spatial data integrity
- Test cross-validation splits

## Cross-validation Testing
- Verify fold assignments
- Test model performance consistency
- Validate spatial block structure
- Check for data leakage
