# Write code with a distributed processing approach

All code suggestions should be made with the context that system it will be running on is an HPC.

The HPC manages jobs using Slurm and supports Apptainer/Singularity containers.

When possible, code that can be parallelized should be written to be parallelizable across multiple machines. In other words, parallelization should be implemented such that the data can be split up and processed independently across processes and machines.
